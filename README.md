**Spray Plus** ("sprAy plus") was the [Funniest Hack winner](https://devpost.com/software/spray-plus) at HackUMass 2017. It's an IOT spray bottle with a Chrome extension that activates when you visit Youtube or Facebook!

Made by Michael Yang and Harrison Liu.

## How it works

The Chrome extension script only runs when the URL matches that of Youtube or Facebook. It then repeatedly pings a local node.js server, which communicates to an Arduino using the Firmata protocol to activate the spray bottle. You can toggle the chrome extension to be on or off as well.
